                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    Passionate about computing and new technologies from a young
                    age, I have always enjoyed understanding how systems work
                    and improving them. I have developed strong skills in
                    diagnosing, repairing, and optimizing computer hardware,
                    which I apply to both personal and professional projects.
                    <br />
                    I constantly stay up to date with the latest technological
                    advancements and adapt my working methods according to new
                    trends and hardware innovations.
                    <br />
                    Independent and meticulous, I enjoy technical challenges and
                    finding efficient solutions to hardware and software issues.
