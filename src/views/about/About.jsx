                <p>
                    I am a Web and Mobile developer, specializing in front-end
                    (React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and back-end (Node.js, PHP,
                    Symfony, SQL/NoSQL). <br />
                    <br />
                    Passionate about computing and new technologies, I build and
                    manage my own home lab with TrueNAS, Proxmox, and Home
                    Assistant, which allows me to experiment with and optimize
                    real systems. <br />
                    <br />I enjoy tackling technical challenges, creating
                    efficient solutions, and exploring new technologies for both
                    personal and professional projects.
